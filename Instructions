For exercise 4, depending on whether you want to do b or c, change line 31.
e.g. fitness_scores = GA('c') to fitness_scores = GA('b')

For exercise 6, one can press run to reproduce the results in the plot.
Note: the MA version of the algorithm takes quite some time.
Different parameters can be set such as the mutation probability,
the number of selections done by the tournament selection, and the population
size.

Other points:
- We chose to do a mu+lambda replacement strategy, but different strategies can
  be employed
- The tournament selection does so with replacement, but this could also be
  without
- The population size must be an even number
